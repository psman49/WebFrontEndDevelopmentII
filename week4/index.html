                The very first thing any person be it a novice or an experienced googler or computer user interacts with on any given browser is the search bar on a browser. 
                This to me was one of the many reasons why I think forms are one of the most amazing pieces designed that make user interaction splendid. 
                The fact that in a search bar you can type in whatever you want on the Web and you got a billion references in a matter of seconds is amazing.
                <br>
                <br>
                The other thing, I wanted to point out is the placeholder attritube that gives any user some sort of hint of what is expected is a game changer 
                because it saves the user time by making sure they are inputing the right information that 
                will trigger the submit event as soon as the submit button is hit.

                I really enjoyed learning about ES6, it’s something I want to get really good at with just how Javascript is becoming more modern.
                <br>
                Something I learned this week is being able to create objects based off a prototype. 
                I had never known about this before and it was really amazing to see how. 
                With prototypes any changes made to one affects all the objects created from the prototype.

                <br>
                Something I felt like I need to get more practice with is chaining functions because I see the benefits of it however, 
                I also learned quickly that with this I need to be good at 
                debugging my code or commenting on it so it’s not so confusing to others who are reading it. 
                <br>

                I am excited to get more hands-on with using the MVC pattern in my code projects.
