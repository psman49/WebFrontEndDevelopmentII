        One can use the call() method to set the value of ‘this’ inside a function to an object that is provided as the first argument.
        
        function sayHello(){ 
            return `Hello, my name is ${ this.name }`;}
            
        const clark = { name: 'Clark' };
        const bruce = { name: 'Bruce' };
        sayHello.call(clark);
        << 'Hello, my name is Clarke'
        sayHello.call(bruce);<br>
        << 'Hello, my name is Bruce'

        Custom properties is something that I thought was really cool to learn about because I feel like
        now its going to help me elevate my programming skills. Whereby I can add a description of what I am intending to do in that function.
        However, why use the description property yet you could just use a comment block to explain what you are doing?
        <strong>Couldn’t quite understand the use of Immediately invoked function expressions?</strong> 
        Asynchronous programming seems to be such a solution in cases where one might want to have a bunch of things running however one
         must carefully avoid creating a callback Hell while working with call back functions.
        Settle Promise => (resolve, rejected) both these outcomes will return data that you will have to work with based on your desired need.
        
        Using async functions is golden because now I can see how if an error happens then it is thrown and once can easily know what they are dealing with.
      
        Closures => Secret to giving access to global variables to functions that are called within other functions.
        Functional programming-> working with pure functions-> the return value only depends on the arguments provided, 
        they don’t change any data in the program, always return the same results given the same arguements
