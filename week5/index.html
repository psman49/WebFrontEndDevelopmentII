                Understanding error types and learning how to throw exceptions is such a beauty in programming. 
                JavaScript being an interactive programming language, 
                throwing exceptions helps guide any user to better navigate 
                an application that they are interacting with.
                
                Something I really never understood until this weeks reading is how to read a stack trace. 
                The program example used of function one() calling calling function two() then calling function() 
                three helped me better under the concept of stack traces 
                and how I can work my way through a program to identify where the error is happening.
                
                I enjoyed playing around with the debugger on my chrome browser to see how things 
                work and how to fix certain bugs that might pop up.
