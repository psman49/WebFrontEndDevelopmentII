                Reading through Chapter 2- 4 in JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, I have some notes and questions.
                <br>
                I came to better understand how to work with and assign variables, data types, 
                how to parse from data type to another and how to work with template literals. 
                <br>
                Template literals helped me see a different way of being able to output any data and not worry 
                much about concatenating but be able to output anything data stored in a variable.
                <br>
                While reading about Arrays, I spend some time working to understand destructing and I still feel 
                like I don’t understand it as much as I would like, and I am going to work on that. 
                Loops showed me how to control the flow of my programs and I hope I get better at them. 
                I have a general understanding of how the different loops work. 
                I want to get better at making the best discretion on when to you what style of loop.
                <br>
                I am going to work on destructing arrays so I better understand how I can work with 
                an array of links that contain a label, URL, challenges 
                so I can have such an amazing portfolio.
                <br>
                For-of loop, is interesting, I don’t get what happens to the condition in this 
                scenario? Like it doesn’t show where the loop starts and ends? Is this all implied, 
                based on the workings behind the scenes in the program, that it’s assumed since 
                the length is known and the starting point we don’t need all that detailed like 
                it is detailed in a traditional for-loop?
                <br>
                Sets are the best data structure to use if you are not wanting any duplicates and
                 arrays, are the opposite. So a conversion between those two data structures 
                 would make sense based on what your need is.
                 <br>
                 Functions helped me understand how to use the logic I want to achieve whatever 
                 I want to achieve while programming. Functions are the cooking pot of whatever 
                 functionality I want any client to receive while I work on ay program, 
                 they interact with. 
                 <br>
                 Why use alert() yet you can always use console.log()? 
                 I mean I see the alert() is helpful if you want a pop up
                  message but then I don’t really the need for that and 
                  mostly in these times I feel.
                <br>
                Do you mean to say that arrow functions are solely for the purpose of writing functions?
                 Like why do we really need them if the body of the function still pretty much 
                 looks the same if there is a lot of code in the function?
