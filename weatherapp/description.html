    <h1>Description of Personal Project- Weather App</h1>
    <pre>
        I chose to build a weather app for my personal project because I am blessed to live in the state of Utah 
        where we get to witness all the weather seasons throughout the year.The app has a search area where you 
        can type in any city in the world and see the weather for that city. I also dessigned it so that it is simple
        for anyone to use.
    </pre>
    <h2>How to use the Weather App</h2>
    <pre>
        In that search area, where you see the word "search", type in any name of the city you want to check the weather
        for in the world. Let us say for example Sandy, you will then hit the search icon to your right, it looks like a 
        tiny frying pan. Once you hit that button, it will bring up the weather results of sandy at that current time.
        It will display the name of the city, how cold it is in Celcius and give a weather description, if it is snowing, 
        sunny, rainny or overcast. You will be able to see the humidity and wind speed of that city as well.
    </pre>
    <h2>Javascript used in my project</h2>
    <pre>
        API- I used the open weather map api(https://openweathermap.org/api) to be fetch the current data weather for any given city.
        I used the fetch method (fectch()) to be to fetch the resouces(city weather) asynchronously across the network.
        With fetch() api we get a a json response and if you are to console.log it you see that there is all this data we can extract 
        out of this response. In my code you can see the I use destructuring assignment syntax to unpack the name,icon,description,humidity 
        and wind speed for the given city.
    </pre>
    <h2>Third-Party APIs</h2>
    <pre>
        I used the openweather map API and with the usage of the fetch() I passed in the url -> https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=" +
        city + "&units=metric&appid=" + this.apiKey. Where you clearly see that i use an apikey, I got when i signed up and from the url you can see
        with the logic of destructing, I was able to unpack the city from the json that we get back when we hit the /weather endpoint and pass 
        in the respective parameters like city, name and api key to retrieve the current weather data for a given city.
    </pre>
    <h2>JSON</h2>
    <pre>
        The response that is got back as asynchronous api call is made with the fetch(), we get back a reponse and if ok,we get the json object data 
        which I unpack using the destructing syntax so that I can extract the data for the city, description, name,speed, temperature and humidity.
        All of this is found in the script.js file.
    </pre>
    <h2>Events</h2>
    <pre>
        You can see that I use the addEventListener, which listens to a click and executes the function to do a weather search.
        And clearly if a response is matched with the city name after the api call is made, we see current weather data for that city
        displayed.
    </pre>
    <h2>CSS Features Used include the following:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The :hover pseudo-class selector for the buttons</li>
            <li>Used different classes </li>
            <li>Different styles for sizing and positioning input fields and their labels</li>
            <li>Used different fonts at different places on my application </li>
            <li>Used the unsplash source rotating backgroung images that change for each respective city </li>
          </ul>
    <h2></h2>
    <h2>Application of Topics from WDD330</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>CMobile-first design from the "Master Mobile UX" video from Week 1</li>
       <li>Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle from Week 2's Team Activity particularly in my script.js</li>
       <li>The principles and techniques for testing and debugging from Week 5 were used throughout the duration of the project</li>
       <li>The RESTful fetch() call to the open weather API was taken nearly verbatim from the Week 11 Team activity/li>
       <li>Form and object-oriented programming (OOP)</li>
     </ul>
