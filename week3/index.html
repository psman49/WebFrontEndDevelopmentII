                Objects are used to keep information or functionality of related items 
                together so we can have easy access to any of the properties. 
                They also provide a useful way of organizing code and quick access. 
                Each property is represented as a key-value pair where you access a property 
                using its key so one can have access to the value of that property.

                I finally got to understand why everything is considered an event in JavaScript. 
                The ability of event listeners to let the programs to know that something 
                has happened is awesome because this pretty much makes the interaction with the user more useful.

                I didn’t quite understand the importance of the Symbol date type in 
                creating objects?
                Can you help me understand what makes node lists array-like objects? 
                Like I couldn’t wrap my head around it?

                When selecting elements on the DOM is there an advantage of using
                Query selection over the usual getElementById() convention?
