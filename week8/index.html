        <strong>Strict Mode</strong>
        How does using Strict Mode defer from just using typescript since in typescript you have to set types for any variable and function?

        For example, consider the following code, which calls a constructor function without the new keyword so that its this will not refer to a newly constructed object:
        function Person(name) { this.name = name; }
        let ferdinand = Person("Ferdinand"); // oops
        console.log(name);
        // → Ferdinand
        So the bogus call to Person succeeded but returned an undefined value and created the global binding name. In strict mode, the result is different.

        "use strict";
        function Person(name) { this.name = name; }
        let ferdinand = Person("Ferdinand"); // forgot new
        // → TypeError: Cannot set property 'name' of undefined

        For this instance using the strict mode, if we edited our code and added the new keyword then it would work and we wouldnt get the type error.

        "use strict";
        function Person(name) { this.name = name; }
        let ferdinand = new Person("Ferdinand"); // forgot new
        // → Ferdinand

        <strong>Debugging</strong>
        In the textbook they go over using console.log() to learn how to see how far your code has gone when you invoke the function you
        wanting to get a result on. So console.log() will return some data for you to see.

        On this very topic I spent some time learning how to use the debugger in vscode mostly when I was working on my javascript.
        Follow the following steps to get it activated.
            ->Pressing F5 (Start Debugging)
            ->Activating the debug icon in the menu bar and selecting "Run and debug"
            ->Opening the Visual Studio Code command palette and running the "Debug: Open Link command"

        <strong>Exceptions</strong>
        The beauty of exceptions is that even if the code runs into issues you are able to see an error that was caught and the 
        program will still continue to run instead of just ending. This makes me appreciate the beauty of asynchronous programming as well
        because you can learn how to structure with this concept and on top of it work with exceptions as you try the block of code and catch if any 
        errors come up.

        Here's an example of an exception.
        function promptDirection(question) {
            let result = prompt(question);
            if (result.toLowerCase() == "left") return "L";
            if (result.toLowerCase() == "right") return "R";
            throw new Error("Invalid direction: " + result);
          }
          
          function look() {
            if (promptDirection("Which way?") == "L") {
              return "a house";
            } else {
              return "two angry bears";
            }
          }
          
          try {
            console.log("You see", look());
          } catch (error) {
            console.log("Something went wrong: " + error);
          }

        Every programmer makes mistakes so using these exceptions prepares one to catch any errors that might comeup.
